## 🛡️ Security Workflow Development

### Creating New Workflows

1. **Workflow Structure**
   ```
   backend/toolbox/workflows/your_workflow/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── workflow.py          # Main Temporal workflow
   ├── activities.py        # Workflow activities (optional)
   ├── metadata.yaml        # Workflow metadata (includes vertical field)
   └── requirements.txt     # Additional dependencies (optional)
   ```

2. **Register Your Workflow**
   Add your workflow to `backend/toolbox/workflows/registry.py`:
   ```python
   # Import your workflow
   from .your_workflow.workflow import main_flow as your_workflow_flow

   # Add to registry
   WORKFLOW_REGISTRY["your_workflow"] = {
       "flow": your_workflow_flow,
       "module_path": "toolbox.workflows.your_workflow.workflow",
       "function_name": "main_flow",
       "description": "Description of your workflow",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "author": "Your Name",
       "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
   }
   ```

3. **Testing Workflows**
   - Create test cases in `test_projects/vulnerable_app/`
   - Ensure SARIF output format compliance
   - Test with various input scenarios

### Security Guidelines

- 🔐 Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- 🛡️ Focus on **defensive security** tools and analysis

- 🧪 Test workflows thoroughly before submission
- 📋 Follow responsible disclosure for security issues
