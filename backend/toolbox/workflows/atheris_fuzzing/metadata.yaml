# Workspace isolation mode (system-level configuration)
# - "isolated" (default): Each workflow run gets its own isolated workspace (safe for concurrent fuzzing)
# - "shared": All runs share the same workspace (for read-only analysis workflows)
# - "copy-on-write": Download once, copy for each run (balances performance and isolation)
