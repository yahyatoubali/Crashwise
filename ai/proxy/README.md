# LLM Proxy Integrations

This directory contains vendor source trees that were vendored only for reference when integrating LLM gateways. The actual Crashwise deployment uses the official Docker images for each project.

See `docs/docs/how-to/llm-proxy.md` for up-to-date instructions on running the proxy services and issuing keys for the agents.
