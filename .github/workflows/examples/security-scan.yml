# Crashwise CI/CD Example - Security Scanning
#
# This workflow demonstrates how to integrate Crashwise into your CI/CD pipeline
# for automated security testing on pull requests and pushes.
#
# Features:
#   - Runs entirely in GitHub Actions (no external infrastructure needed)
#   - Auto-starts Crashwise services on-demand
#   - Fails builds on error-level SARIF findings
#   - Uploads SARIF results to GitHub Security tab
#   - Exports findings as artifacts
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Ubuntu runner with Docker support
#   - At least 4GB RAM available
#   - ~90 seconds startup time
