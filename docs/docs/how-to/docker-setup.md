# Docker Requirements for Crashwise

Crashwise runs entirely in Docker containers with Temporal orchestration. This guide covers system requirements, worker profiles, and resource management to help you run Crashwise efficiently.

---

## System Requirements

### Docker Version

- **Docker Engine**: 20.10.0 or later
- **Docker Compose**: 2.0.0 or later

Verify your installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB+ |
| Disk | 20 GB free | 50 GB+ free |
| Network | Internet access | Stable connection |

### Port Requirements

Crashwise services use these ports (must be available):

| Port | Service | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 8000 | Backend API | FastAPI server |
| 8080 | Temporal UI | Workflow monitoring |
| 7233 | Temporal gRPC | Workflow execution |
| 9000 | MinIO API | S3-compatible storage |
| 9001 | MinIO Console | Storage management |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | Temporal database |

Check for port conflicts:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :8000,8080,7233,9000,9001,5432

# Or just try starting Crashwise
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

---

## Worker Profiles (Resource Optimization)

Crashwise uses Docker Compose **profiles** to prevent workers from auto-starting. This saves 5-7GB of RAM by only running workers when needed.

### Profile Configuration

Workers are configured with profiles in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
worker-ossfuzz:
  profiles:
    - workers    # For starting all workers
    - ossfuzz    # For starting just this worker
  restart: "no"  # Don't auto-restart

worker-python:
  profiles:
    - workers
    - python
  restart: "no"

worker-rust:
  profiles:
    - workers
    - rust
  restart: "no"
```

### Default Behavior

**`docker compose up -d`** starts only core services:
- temporal
- temporal-ui
- postgresql
- minio
- minio-setup
- backend
- task-agent

Workers remain stopped until needed.

### On-Demand Worker Startup

When you run a workflow via the CLI, Crashwise automatically starts the required worker:

```bash
# Automatically starts worker-python
crashwise workflow run atheris_fuzzing ./project

# Automatically starts worker-rust
crashwise workflow run cargo_fuzzing ./rust-project

# Automatically starts worker-secrets
crashwise workflow run secret_detection ./codebase
```

### Manual Worker Management

**Quick Reference - Workflow to Worker Mapping:**

| Workflow | Worker Service | Docker Command |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| `security_assessment`, `python_sast`, `llm_analysis`, `atheris_fuzzing` | worker-python | `docker compose up -d worker-python` |
| `android_static_analysis` | worker-android | `docker compose up -d worker-android` |
| `cargo_fuzzing` | worker-rust | `docker compose up -d worker-rust` |
| `ossfuzz_campaign` | worker-ossfuzz | `docker compose up -d worker-ossfuzz` |
| `llm_secret_detection`, `trufflehog_detection`, `gitleaks_detection` | worker-secrets | `docker compose up -d worker-secrets` |

Crashwise CLI provides convenient commands for managing workers:

```bash
# List all workers and their status
cw worker list
cw worker list --all  # Include stopped workers

# Start a specific worker
cw worker start python
cw worker start android --build  # Rebuild before starting

# Stop all workers
cw worker stop
```

You can also use Docker commands directly:

```bash
# Start a single worker
docker start crashwise-worker-python

# Start all workers at once (uses more RAM)
docker compose --profile workers up -d

# Stop a worker to free resources
docker stop crashwise-worker-ossfuzz
```

### Stopping Workers Properly

The easiest way to stop workers is using the CLI:

```bash
# Stop all running workers (recommended)
cw worker stop
```

This command safely stops all worker containers without affecting core services.

Alternatively, you can use Docker commands:

```bash
# Stop individual worker
docker stop crashwise-worker-python

# Stop all workers using docker compose
# Note: This requires the --profile flag because workers are in profiles
docker compose down --profile workers
```

**Important:** Workers use Docker Compose profiles to prevent auto-starting. When using Docker commands directly:
- `docker compose down` (without `--profile workers`) does NOT stop workers
- Workers remain running unless explicitly stopped with the profile flag or `docker stop`
- Use `cw worker stop` for the safest option that won't affect core services

### Resource Comparison

| Command | Workers Started | RAM Usage |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| `docker compose up -d` | None (core only) | ~1.2 GB |
| `crashwise workflow run atheris_fuzzing .` | Python worker only | ~2-3 GB |
| `crashwise workflow run ossfuzz_campaign .` | OSS-Fuzz worker only | ~3-5 GB |
| `docker compose --profile workers up -d` | All workers | ~8 GB |

## Storage Management

### Docker Volume Cleanup

Crashwise creates Docker volumes for persistent data. Clean them up periodically:

```bash
# Remove unused volumes (safe - keeps volumes for running containers)
docker volume prune

# List Crashwise volumes
docker volume ls | grep crashwise

# Remove specific volume (WARNING: deletes data)
docker volume rm crashwise_minio-data
```

### Cache Directory

Workers use `/cache` inside containers for downloaded targets. This is managed automatically with LRU eviction, but you can check usage:

```bash
# Check cache usage in a worker
docker exec crashwise-worker-python du -sh /cache

# Clear cache manually if needed (safe - will re-download targets)
docker exec crashwise-worker-python rm -rf /cache/*
```

---

## Environment Configuration

Crashwise requires `volumes/env/.env` to start. This file contains API keys and configuration:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp volumes/env/.env.template volumes/env/.env

# Edit to add your API keys (if using AI features)
nano volumes/env/.env
```

See [Getting Started](../tutorial/getting-started.md) for detailed environment setup.

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

**Check ports are available:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml ps
lsof -i :8000,8080,7233,9000,9001
```

**Check Docker resources:**
```bash
docker system df
docker system prune  # Free up space if needed
```

### Worker Memory Issues

If workers crash with OOM (out of memory) errors:

1. **Close other applications** to free RAM
2. **Start only needed workers** (don't use `--profile workers`)
3. **Increase Docker Desktop memory limit** (Settings → Resources)
4. **Monitor usage**: `docker stats`

### Slow Worker Startup

Workers pull large images (~2-5GB each) on first run:

```bash
# Check download progress
docker compose logs worker-python -f

# Pre-pull images (optional)
docker compose pull
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Default startup**: Use `docker compose up -d` (core services only)
2. **Let CLI manage workers**: Workers start automatically when workflows run
3. **Stop unused workers**: Free RAM when not running workflows
4. **Monitor resources**: `docker stats` shows real-time usage
5. **Regular cleanup**: `docker system prune` removes unused images/containers
6. **Backup volumes**: `docker volume ls` shows persistent data locations
