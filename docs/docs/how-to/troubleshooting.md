# Troubleshooting Crashwise

Running into issues with Crashwise? This guide will help you diagnose and resolve the most common problems—whether you’re just getting started or running complex workflows. Each section is focused on a specific area, with actionable steps and explanations.

---

## Quick Checks: Is Everything Running?

Before diving into specific errors, let’s check the basics:

```bash
# Check all Crashwise services
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml ps

# Test service health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8080  # Temporal Web UI
curl http://localhost:9000  # MinIO API
curl http://localhost:9001  # MinIO Console
```

If any of these commands fail, note the error message and continue below.

## Environment Configuration Issues

### Docker Compose fails with "file not found" or variable errors

**What's happening?**
The required `volumes/env/.env` file is missing. Docker Compose needs this file to start.

**How to fix:**
```bash
# Create the environment file from the template
cp volumes/env/.env.template volumes/env/.env

# Restart Docker Compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**Note:** You can leave the `.env` file with default values if you're only using basic workflows (no AI features).

### API key errors for AI features

**What's happening?**
AI-powered workflows (like `llm_secret_detection`) or the AI agent need API keys.

**How to fix:**
1. Edit `volumes/env/.env` and add your keys:
   ```env
   LITELLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```

2. Restart the backend to pick up new environment variables:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart backend
   ```

**Which workflows need API keys?**
- ✅ **Don't need keys**: `security_assessment`, `gitleaks_detection`, `trufflehog_detection`, `atheris_fuzzing`, `cargo_fuzzing`
- ⚠️ **Need keys**: `llm_secret_detection`, AI agent (`crashwise ai agent`)

## Workflow Execution Issues

### Upload fails or file access errors

**What's happening?**
File upload to MinIO failed or worker can't download target.

**How to fix:**
- Check MinIO is running:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps minio
  ```
- Check MinIO logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs minio
  ```
- Verify MinIO is accessible:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:9000
  ```
- Check file size (max 10GB by default).

### Workflow status is "Failed" or "Running" (stuck)

**What's happening?**
- "Failed": Usually a target download, storage, or tool error.
- "Running" (stuck): Worker is overloaded, target download failed, or worker crashed.

**How to fix:**
- Check worker logs for details:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs worker-rust | tail -50
  ```
- Check Temporal Web UI at http://localhost:8080 for detailed execution history
- Restart services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
  ```
- Reduce the number of concurrent workflows if your system is resource-constrained.

### Workflow requires worker not running

**What's happening?**
You see a warning message like:
```
⚠️  Could not check worker requirements: Cannot find docker-compose.yml.
   Ensure backend is running, run from Crashwise directory, or set
   CRASHWISE_ROOT environment variable.
   Continuing without worker management...
```

Or the workflow fails to start because the required worker isn't running.

**How to fix:**
Start the worker required for your workflow before running it:

| Workflow | Worker Required | Startup Command |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| `android_static_analysis` | worker-android | `docker compose up -d worker-android` |
| `security_assessment` | worker-python | `docker compose up -d worker-python` |
| `python_sast` | worker-python | `docker compose up -d worker-python` |
| `llm_analysis` | worker-python | `docker compose up -d worker-python` |
| `atheris_fuzzing` | worker-python | `docker compose up -d worker-python` |
| `ossfuzz_campaign` | worker-ossfuzz | `docker compose up -d worker-ossfuzz` |
| `cargo_fuzzing` | worker-rust | `docker compose up -d worker-rust` |
| `llm_secret_detection` | worker-secrets | `docker compose up -d worker-secrets` |
| `trufflehog_detection` | worker-secrets | `docker compose up -d worker-secrets` |
| `gitleaks_detection` | worker-secrets | `docker compose up -d worker-secrets` |

**Check worker status:**
```bash
# Check if a specific worker is running
docker compose ps worker-android

# Check all workers
docker compose ps | grep worker
```

**Note:** Workers don't auto-start by default to save system resources. For more details on worker management, see the [Docker Setup guide](docker-setup.md#worker-management).

## Service Connectivity Issues

### Backend (port 8000) or Temporal UI (port 8233) not responding

**How to fix:**
- Check if the service is running:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps crashwise-backend
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps temporal
  ```
- View logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs crashwise-backend --tail 50
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs temporal --tail 20
  ```
- Restart the affected service:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml restart crashwise-backend
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml restart temporal
  ```

---

## CLI Issues

### "crashwise: command not found"

**How to fix:**
- Install the CLI:
  ```bash
  cd cli
  pip install -e .
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  uv tool install .
  ```
- Check your PATH:
  ```bash
  which crashwise
  echo $PATH
  ```
- As a fallback:
  ```bash
  python -m crashwise_cli --help
  ```

### CLI connection errors

**How to fix:**
- Make sure the backend is running and healthy.
- Check your CLI config:
  ```bash
  crashwise config show
  ```
- Update the server URL if needed:
  ```bash
  crashwise config set-server http://localhost:8000
  ```

## System Resource Issues

### Out of disk space

**How to fix:**
- Clean up Docker:
  ```bash
  docker system prune -f
  docker image prune -f
  docker volume prune -f  # Remove unused volumes
  ```
- Clean worker cache manually if needed:
  ```bash
  docker exec crashwise-worker-python rm -rf /cache/*
  docker exec crashwise-worker-rust rm -rf /cache/*
  ```

### High memory usage

**How to fix:**
- Limit the number of concurrent workflows.
- Add swap space if possible.
- Restart services to free up memory.

---

## Network Issues

### Services can’t communicate

**How to fix:**
- Check Docker network configuration:
  ```bash
  docker network ls
  docker network inspect crashwise-temporal_default
  ```
- Recreate the network:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
  docker network prune -f
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
  ```

---

## Workflow-Specific Issues

### Static analysis or secret detection finds no issues

**What’s happening?**
- Your code may be clean, or the workflow isn’t scanning the right files.

**How to fix:**
- Make sure your target contains files to analyze:
  ```bash
  find /path/to/target -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.java" | head -10
  ```
- Test with a known-vulnerable project or file.

---

## Getting Help and Diagnostics

### Enable debug logging

```bash
export TEMPORAL_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs crashwise-backend -f
```

### Collect diagnostic info

Save and run this script to gather info for support:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Crashwise Diagnostics ==="
date
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml ps
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Backend unhealthy"
curl -s http://localhost:8080 >/dev/null && echo "Temporal UI healthy" || echo "Temporal UI unhealthy"
curl -s http://localhost:9000 >/dev/null && echo "MinIO healthy" || echo "MinIO unhealthy"
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml logs --tail 10
```
