# Crashwise AI: Conceptual Overview

Welcome to Crashwise AI—a multi-agent orchestration platform designed to supercharge your intelligent automation, security workflows, and project knowledge management. This document provides a high-level conceptual introduction to what Crashwise AI is, what problems it solves, and how its architecture enables powerful, context-aware agent collaboration.

## What is Crashwise AI?

Crashwise AI is a multi-agent orchestration system that implements the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for intelligent agent routing, persistent memory management, and project-scoped knowledge graphs. Think of it as an intelligent hub that coordinates a team of specialized agents, each with their own skills, while maintaining context and knowledge across sessions and projects.

**Key Goals:**
- Seamlessly route requests to the right agent for the job
- Preserve and leverage project-specific knowledge
- Enable secure, auditable, and extensible automation workflows
- Make multi-agent collaboration as easy as talking to a single assistant

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Agent Orchestration**
Crashwise AI acts as a conductor, automatically routing your requests to the most capable registered agent. Agents can be local or remote, and each advertises its skills and capabilities via the A2A protocol.

### 2. **Memory & Knowledge Management**
The system features a three-layer memory architecture:
- **Session Persistence:** Keeps track of ongoing sessions and conversations.
- **Semantic Memory:** Archives conversations and enables semantic search.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Maintains structured, project-scoped knowledge for deep context.

### 3. **Artifact System**
Artifacts are files or structured content generated, processed, or shared by agents. The artifact system supports creation, storage, and secure sharing of code, configs, reports, and more—enabling reproducible, auditable workflows.

### 4. **A2A Protocol Compliance**
Crashwise AI fully implements the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol (spec 0.3.0), ensuring standardized, interoperable communication between agents—whether they're running locally or across the network.

## High-Level Architecture

Here's how the main components fit together:

```
Crashwise AI System
├── CLI Interface (cli.py)
│   ├── Commands & Session Management
│   └── Agent Registry Persistence
├── Agent Core (agent.py)
│   ├── Main Coordinator
│   └── Memory Manager Integration
├── Agent Executor (agent_executor.py)
│   ├── Tool Management & Orchestration
│   ├── ROUTE_TO Pattern Implementation
│   └── Artifact Creation & Management
├── Memory Architecture (Three Layers)
│   ├── Session Persistence
│   ├── Semantic Memory
│   └── Knowledge Graphs
├── A2A Communication Layer
│   ├── Remote Agent Connection
│   ├── Agent Card Management
│   └── Protocol Compliance
└── A2A Server (a2a_server.py)
    ├── HTTP/SSE Server
    ├── Artifact HTTP Serving
    └── Task Store & Queue Management
```

**How it works:**
1. **User Input:** You interact via CLI or API, using natural language or commands.
2. **Agent Routing:** The system decides whether to handle the request itself or route it to a specialist agent.
3. **Tool Execution:** Built-in and agent-provided tools perform operations.
4. **Memory Integration:** Results and context are stored for future use.
5. **Response Generation:** The system returns results, often with artifacts or actionable insights.
