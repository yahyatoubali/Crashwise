# Crashwise v0.7.0: Temporal Orchestration & Vertical Workers Architecture

We're excited to announce **Crashwise v0.7.0**, a major release featuring two significant improvements:

1. **Architectural Foundation**: Complete migration from Prefect to **Temporal** orchestration with **vertical workers** - pre-built containers for instant deployment
2. **AI-Powered Secret Detection**: New workflows achieving 84% recall on obfuscated secrets using LLM semantic analysis

This release transforms how security workflows are built, deployed, and scaled.

## 🚀 Flagship Features

### Temporal Orchestration: Production-Ready Workflow Engine

We've fully migrated from Prefect to [Temporal](https://temporal.io), bringing enterprise-grade workflow orchestration to Crashwise:

**Why Temporal?**

- ✅ **Reliability**: Automatic retries, timeouts, and failure handling built-in
- ✅ **Observability**: World-class UI for monitoring workflow execution, logs, and debugging
- ✅ **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across workers with intelligent load balancing
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Type-safe workflows, versioning, and zero downtime deployments

**What This Means for You:**

```bash
# Start Crashwise with Temporal
docker compose up -d

# Monitor workflows in real-time
open http://localhost:8080  # Temporal UI

# Submit workflows - everything just works
cd your_project/
cw workflow run security_assessment .
```

The Temporal UI gives you complete visibility into workflow execution:

- Live activity timelines
- Detailed logs for every step
- Retry history and failure analysis
- Performance metrics and bottleneck detection

### Vertical Workers: Pre-Built Security Toolchains

Crashwise now uses **vertical workers** - long-lived containers pre-built with security toolchains for different languages and platforms:

| Worker      | Toolchain                     | Status        | Available Workflows                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **python**  | Gitleaks, TruffleHog, Atheris | ✅ Production | Secret detection, security assessment |
| **rust**    | cargo-fuzz                    | ⚠️ Early Dev  | Rust fuzzing                          |
| **ossfuzz** | OSS-Fuzz infrastructure       | ⚠️ Heavy Dev  | Continuous fuzzing campaigns          |

**Note:** Additional workers (web, android, Go) are planned but not yet available.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Zero Build Time**: Workflows start instantly - no container builds per workflow
2. **Instant Code Changes**: Modify workflow code, restart worker, done
3. **Consistent Environment**: Same toolchain versions across all runs
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Share workers across multiple concurrent workflows

**Example: Running Secret Detection**

```bash
# Worker is already running with Gitleaks, TruffleHog installed
cw workflow run gitleaks_detection .

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. CLI uploads project to MinIO
# 2. Temporal schedules on python-worker
# 3. Worker downloads from MinIO
# 4. Gitleaks runs (already installed!)
# 5. Results returned as SARIF
```

### MinIO Storage: Unified File Handling

We've replaced volume mounts with **MinIO** (S3-compatible object storage):

**Old Way (Volume Mounts):**

```yaml
# Had to mount directories, manage paths, cleanup manually
volumes:
  - ./my_project:/target
```

**New Way (MinIO):**

```bash
# CLI handles everything automatically
cw workflow run security_assessment .
# ✓ Creates tarball
# ✓ Uploads to MinIO
# ✓ Passes target_id to workflow
# ✓ Worker downloads and extracts
# ✓ Cleanup handled automatically
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No path conflicts or permissions issues
- ✅ Works seamlessly with remote Temporal clusters
- ✅ Automatic cleanup and caching
- ✅ Supports large targets (GB+)

## 🔍 AI-Powered Secret Detection: Also in v0.7.0

Alongside the architectural improvements, we're releasing a comprehensive **secret detection** system with three workflows:

### Benchmark Results

We tested on a controlled dataset of **32 documented secrets** (12 Easy, 10 Medium, 10 Hard):

| Tool                  | Recall    | Secrets Found | Speed | Best For                    |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| **LLM (gpt-5-mini)**  | **84.4%** | 41            | 618s  | Obfuscated & hidden secrets |
| **LLM (gpt-4o-mini)** | 56.2%     | 30            | 297s  | Balanced speed/accuracy     |
| **Gitleaks**          | 37.5%     | 12            | 5s    | Fast pattern-based scanning |
| **TruffleHog**        | 0.0%      | 1             | 5s    | Entropy analysis            |

### Why LLM-Based Detection Wins

**Obfuscated Secrets (Medium Difficulty):**

```python
# Gitleaks: ❌ Missed (no pattern match)
# LLM: ✅ Found (semantic understanding)
aws_key = base64.b64decode("QUtJQUlPU0ZPRE5ON0VYQU1QTEU=").decode()
```

**Well-Hidden Secrets (Hard Difficulty):**

```python
# Gitleaks: ❌ Missed (no pattern)
# LLM: ✅ Found (understands XOR + join)
secret = ''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ 0x42) for c in "\x0b\x15\x04\x1b...")
```

**Standard Secrets (Easy Difficulty):**

```python
# Both find these:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
```

### Try It Yourself

```bash
# Start Crashwise
docker compose up -d

# Run secret detection on your code
cd your_project/
cw workflow run gitleaks_detection .      # Fast pattern-based
cw workflow run trufflehog_detection .    # Entropy analysis
cw workflow run llm_secret_detection .    # AI semantic analysis

# Get SARIF output
cw finding <run-id>
```

## 📊 Real-World Impact

**Before v0.7.0 (Pattern-Only Detection):**

- Found: Standard API keys, simple patterns
- Missed: Base64-encoded secrets, obfuscated credentials, split secrets

**After v0.7.0 (LLM + Patterns):**

- **84% recall** on comprehensive benchmark
- Detects novel obfuscation techniques
- Understands code context (not just regex)
- Catches secrets in:
  - Base64/hex encoding
  - String concatenation
  - XOR/ROT13 obfuscation
  - Template strings
  - Binary literals

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### What Changed

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
# Old (Prefect)
docker-compose up

# New (Temporal)
docker compose up -d
```

**Workflow Submission:**

```bash
# Old (volume mounts)
cw workflow run security_assessment --volume ./project

# New (automatic upload)
cw workflow run security_assessment .
# CLI handles upload automatically!
```

**Worker Management:**

```bash
# Old (per-workflow containers)
# Each workflow built its own container

# New (vertical workers)
docker compose up -d  # All workers start
# Workflows share workers - much faster!
```

### Configuration

Set up AI workflows with API keys:

```bash
cp volumes/env/.env.template volumes/env/.env
# Edit .env and add your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
```

Required for:

- `llm_secret_detection` workflow
- AI agent features (`cw ai agent`)

Basic security workflows (gitleaks, trufflehog, security_assessment) work without this.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────┐
│   User CLI  │ Upload → MinIO
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓ Submit
┌─────────────┐
│  Temporal   │ Schedule → Task Queue
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓ Execute
┌─────────────┐
│  Vertical   │ Download from MinIO → Run Tools → Upload Results
│  Workers    │
└─────────────┘
  rust, python, web, android, ossfuzz
```

**Benefits:**

- 🔄 Automatic retries and timeouts (Temporal)
- 📦 No file path management (MinIO)
- ⚡ Zero container build time (Vertical Workers)
- 📈 Horizontal scaling ready (Temporal + Workers)

## 🎯 Workflow Stability Status

### ✅ Stable & Production-Ready

- **Secret Detection**: `gitleaks_detection`, `trufflehog_detection`, `llm_secret_detection`
- **Security Assessment**: `security_assessment`
- Temporal orchestration with python worker
- MinIO file storage

### ⚠️ Early Development (Functional but not production-ready)

- **Fuzzing workflows**:
  - `atheris_fuzzing` - Python fuzzing with Atheris
  - `cargo_fuzzing` - Rust fuzzing with cargo-fuzz
- **OSS-Fuzz integration**: `ossfuzz_campaign` (under heavy active development)

**Important:** Fuzzing workflows are functional for testing but not recommended for production use yet.
